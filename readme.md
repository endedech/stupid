### how to use the bot
#### make a token
- create a new app [Developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) 
- make it a discord bot
- generate and copy a new token

#### Selfhosting
- install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- create a new folder
- run a new terminal window
- clone the repo to the folder
- run `npm run YOUR_TOKEN` (change YOUR_TOKEN to the token you copied above)

#### How to get the badge 
- when the bot starts up invite it to your server (should give a link)
- ask a friend or use an alt account to use the command `/lol`
- if it's a fresh bot then sometimes you might need to wait 24h for verification 
- if it all goes to plan you can reedem your badge [here](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer)
